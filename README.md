## Brance:Data Science Final Year
## College:Narsimha Reddy Engineering College
# Project Title:
Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customer.csv" file of American Mall market called as Phonic Mall, find out on the basis of clients requirements of dendograms using Scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hirerchy", to ace the No. of linkeage as a clustering to predict.
# Problem Statement:
The American Finanace clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market.
As a Data Science Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcomming future.
# Task-1:
With the help of scipy library import the libraries and import the dataset
# task-2:
Using the Dendogram to find the optimal number of clusters.
# Task-3:
Create a hirarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib library.
# Project Approach:

# Conclusion:
According to the model building as a engineer my predicition is Cluster-3 as give highest number of linkage.
# Insights:
## Cluster-1 contains(Red) which shows that Unsupervised Learning cluster as maximum Eculidian Distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 139ks
## Cluster-2 contains(Blue) which shows that Unsupervised Learning cluster as maximum Eculidian distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 79 to 80ks
## Cluster-3 contains(Green) which shows that Unsupervised Learning cluster as maximum Eculidian distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 139ks
## Cluster-4 contains(Skyblue) which shows that Unsupervised Learning cluster as maximum Eculidian distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 40ks
## Cluster-5 contains(Pink) which shows that Unsupervised Learning cluster as maximum Eculidian distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 40ks
